## About This Project

This repository is the complete submission for the Open Source Audit capstone project. The chosen open-source software is **Git** — the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Git was chosen because its origin story is one of the most compelling in open-source history: it was built in direct response to the withdrawal of a proprietary tool's free licence. Its creation is inseparable from the philosophy of software freedom that this course explores.

The repository contains five shell scripts and a written project report covering Units 1–5 of the course.

## Script Descriptions

### Script 1 — System Identity Report
**File:** `script1_system_identity.sh`

Displays a formatted welcome screen showing the current Linux system's identity:
- Linux distribution name and kernel version
- Logged-in user and their home directory
- System uptime and current date/time
- The open-source licence covering the OS (GPL v2)

**Shell concepts:** Variables, command substitution `$()`, `echo` formatting, `cat /etc/os-release`, `grep`, `cut`

---

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector
**File:** `script2_package_inspector.sh`

Checks whether the `git` package is installed on the system. Supports both RPM-based (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) and Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian) distributions. Displays version, licence, and summary. Uses a `case` statement to print a philosophy note about git and other well-known open-source packages.

**Shell concepts:** `if-then-else`, `case` statement, `rpm -qi`, `dpkg -l`, `grep -E`, `command -v`, pipe chaining

---

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor
**File:** `script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh`

Loops through an array of important system directories (`/etc`, `/var/log`, `/home`, `/usr/bin`, `/tmp`, `/var`, `/opt`) and reports permissions, owner, group, and disk usage for each. Also audits Git's system-wide and user-level configuration files specifically.

**Shell concepts:** Array declaration, `for` loop over array, `[ -d ]` directory test, `ls -ld`, `awk`, `du -sh`, `printf` for formatted output, `2>/dev/null`

---

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer
**File:** `script4_log_analyzer.sh`

Reads a log file line by line and counts how many lines contain a given keyword (default: `error`, case-insensitive). Prints the last 5 matching lines. Implements a do-while style retry mechanism to try fallback log file locations if the specified file does not exist.

**Shell concepts:** Command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`), default value assignment (`${2:-"error"}`), `while IFS= read -r` loop, `if-then` inside loop, counter variables `$(( ))`, bash array accumulation, array slicing, do-while simulation, `exit` codes

---

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator
**File:** `script5_manifesto_generator.sh`

Interactively asks the user three questions and composes a personalised open-source philosophy statement using their answers. Saves the manifesto to a `.txt` file named after the current user. Demonstrates the alias concept through a helper function pattern.

**Shell concepts:** `read -p` for interactive input, string interpolation in `echo`, file writing with `>` and `>>`, `date` command, `whoami`, input validation with `[ -z ]`, function definition as alias pattern, `cat` for output display

---

## How to Run the Scripts

### Prerequisites
- A Linux system (physical machine, virtual machine, or WSL2)
- Bash shell (version 4.0 or later)
- For Script 2: either `rpm` (RPM-based distros) or `dpkg` (Debian-based distros)
- For Script 4: a readable log file (see note below)

### Step 1 — Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarthak50/Open_Source_Project_GIT.git
cd Open_Source_Project_GIT
```

### Step 2 — Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 3 — Run each script

**Script 1 — System Identity Report**
```bash
./scripts/script1_system_identity.sh
```
No arguments required. Displays system information immediately.

---

**Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector**
```bash
./scripts/script2_package_inspector.sh
```
No arguments required. Checks for `git` package automatically. Ensure git is installed first:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install git
```

---

**Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor**
```bash
./scripts/script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh
```
No arguments required. Audits standard system directories and Git config locations.
> Note: Some directories (like `/var/log`) may require sudo for size reporting:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh
```

---

**Script 4 — Log File Analyzer**
```bash
# Basic usage with default keyword 'error'
./scripts/script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog

# With a custom keyword
./scripts/script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog WARNING

# On Fedora/CentOS — use messages instead
./scripts/script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/messages error
```
> If no log file is accessible, the script will automatically try fallback locations.

---

**Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator**
```bash
./scripts/script5_manifesto_generator.sh
```
Interactive — the script will prompt you for three answers. Your manifesto is saved as `manifesto_[yourusername].txt` in the current directory.
