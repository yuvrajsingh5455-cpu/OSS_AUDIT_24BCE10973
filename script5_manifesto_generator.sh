# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: RAHUL| Reg No: 24BCE10973
# Course: Open Source Software | OSS NGMC Capstone Project
# Description: Interactively asks the user three questions
#              and composes a personalised open-source
#              philosophy statement, saved to a .txt file.
# ============================================================

# ============================================================
# ALIAS CONCEPT (demonstrated via comment and function)
# In a real shell session, 'alias' creates shorthand commands.
# Example: alias gs='git status'
# Here we define a helper function — the function-as-alias pattern.
